"RomasPackage" includes simple tools to clean, summarize, and normalize data frames in R, it also has functions for removing rows with missing values, summing numeric columns, and normalizing numeric vectors to a 0-1 range. It is designed for quick and easy data without requiring advanced packages.

I used for unique functions which were removing missing values, numeric function, sum of values, and cleaning and preprocessing data 

This did not need any packages. It was meant to be basic and simple for people who are new with coding and R
